_Hans in the Land of Bards_ is an adventure story about an absentminded tailor and his quick-witted accomplice who struggle to escape a land where things aren’t always what they seem. During the journey, our protagonist is exposed to concepts that are ubiquitous in software, but whose usefulness extends beyond that field. Much as in life, the lessons come in the form of _head fakes_, which means that our protagonist doesn’t realize at the time that he is learning anything of value.

## Release date
Part I is planned for release on March 15, 2015. Parts II and III are planned for release by the end of 2015.

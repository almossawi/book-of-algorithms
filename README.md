_A Book of Algorithms_ is an upcoming three-part story about a witty tailor in a foreign land who learns how to think by learning about a set of fundamental computing algorithms. This repository will include the entire codebase for the project, to encourage and facilitate collaboration. Of course, you are also welcome to send me your comments via email or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alialmossawi).

## Release date

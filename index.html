        <p class='no-indent authors-intro'>This is a story about an absentminded tailor and his quick-witted 
        accomplice who struggle to escape a land where things aren’t always what they seem. During the journey, 
        our protagonist is exposed to concepts that are ubiquitous in software, but whose usefulness extends beyond 
        that field. Much as in life, the lessons come in the form of ‘head fakes,’ which means that our protagonist 
        doesn’t realize at the time that he is learning anything of value. This work is dedicated

                to see dead relatives as one approaches the land of no return. So it was that Hans 
                found himself fending off his deceased Aunt Jennifer’s projectiles with a shield that looked
                suspiciously like a bin lid.</p>

                <p>“All I want is one fish stick,” he pleaded, but much as
                in his childhood, his mother’s sister&mdash;now grown to the size of the Gorton man’s
                fishing boat&mdash;stood between him and the innocent pleasures of his favorite lunchtime
                treat.</p>

                <p>“Eat your vegetables!” she roared, as she lobbed another enormous brussels
                sprout at his face.</p>

                <p>This was no way to spend eternity. Restrained from eating his
                food item of choice. With whatever energy was left in him, which mind you wasn’t all that much, 
                Hans pried his eyes open and lifted his head. It was time to get moving.</p>

                <p>The piscine mouth that had swallowed him whole only moments before had carried him
                into the fish’s belly&mdash;a dark and humid cavern of a place, not too dissimilar to the
                wretched hotel lobby where he had made the puffer fish’s acquaintance. To Hans’ cost, alas.</p>

                <p>He was feeling distressed and figured that a two-day stay at the hotel on the hill would do 
                him good. At the very least, it would lessen his anxiety. Poor Hans worried about a lot of things. 
                But mostly, he worried about not having anything to worry about.</p>

                <p>Hans shuffled along for several yards and then stepped out onto a soft patch of mud, freshly 
                pounded by an overcast sky that was in the early stages of relieving itself.</p>

                <p class='pic3-link'>It was a rainforest. And a vast one at that, with lanky trees 
                for as far as the eye could see. An attention-seeking breeze shook the leaves in front of him, before 
                fraternizing with another bunch of leaves farther away.</p>

                <p>“It can’t be done, mate. It simply can’t be done.”</p>

                <p>A middle-aged man with a thick, black, almost Nietzsche-esque moustache, sat on
                a rock, cheeks resting on the palms of his hands, eyes shut. His dark suit,
                brownish homburg and matching leather briefcase lent him the appearance of a
                businessman. And yet, the earplugs that he had placed firmly up his nostrils suggested 
                that he was perhaps a few chips short of a fish dinner.</p>

                <p>“Hello there,” Hans said. The man did not look up.</p>

                <p>“Interested in buying life insurance? Figured not.”</p>

                <p>“Excuse me, do you, well, do you, I mean, are you from around here, by any
                chance? I’m trying to find my way back to the hotel and I’m kind of lost.”</p>

                <p>“You and me both, mate.” He let out a deep breath.</p>

                <p>“Is there no way out?”</p>

                <p>“Way out? Out of where?”</p>

                <p>“Here. Whatever this place is.”</p>

                <p>The man opened his eyes and looked at Hans. He blew his nose in a super-smooth,
                cavalier sort of way. The earplugs popped out onto to the ground.</p>

                <p>“Why on Earth would you want to leave? This is where blokes like us make
                bumloads of bangers and mash, what with all of those wild cats and birds here, none
                of whom—” He looked around to make sure no one else was listening and then beckoned
                for Hans to get closer. “None of whom have any life insurance. Don’t you see what an
                opportunity this is?”</p>

                <p>“Why do you need me? Why can’t you do it by yourself?”</p>

                <p class='footnote1-link'>“Because Mickey McCoy here is old and slow. Listen up, I’m telling 
                you, there are thousands of potential customers around here. If I could figure out how to get 
                to all of them by sundown, I’d be swimming in cash. But I keep passing by the same old faces. 
                The same old critters. All of whom have the short-term memory of a goldfish. I could really 
                use that clever-looking nut of yours.”</p>

                <p>“I’m terribly sorry. Mr. Rogers is stopping by on Wednesday to pick up his suit
                and I’ve yet to finish it. Also, there’s this whole being-swallowed-by-a-fish
                business that I need to figure out.”</p>

                <p>“Off with the blinkers!”</p>

                <p>Hans raised his eyebrows. “Blinkers?”</p>

                <p>“There’s more to a race than the finish line, son. Think about that. Let it sink
                in.” Hans scratched the back of his neck. “But seriously, now. I’ve got these two deaf badgers 
                who need my Platinum Plan, only they don’t know it yet. You’re just the honest-looking bloke 
                to convince them of it. What do you say?”</p>

                <p>“I can’t, Mr. McCoy. I do alterations and pick fabrics for people. I don’t know
                the first thing about selling life insurance plans.”</p>

                <p>It was then that McCoy leapt onto Hans, moustache and all. A starving tiger lunging towards an 
                unsuspecting antelope. He bodyslammed the hapless tailor onto the muddy Earth and held on tight. 
                “Don’t leave me, son. Stray from the well-trodden path. We’ll be rich.”</p>

                <p>“Let go of me this instant, you maniac!” Hans screamed as he wiggled his way out of
                McCoy’s grasp. When Hans’ arms broke free, he grabbed the moustache before him from either end and
                tugged on that abomination until McCoy’s eyes teared up and he let out a desperate
                moan. Like a constipated seal about to be a hero.</p>

                <p>“You monster!” He caressed his compromised facial hair.</p>

                <p>Hans got up on his feet and scurried away. He ran as fast as he could through the trees,
                for what seemed like miles, pumped by pure adrenaline. The excitement would have kept him going
                were it not for a massive brick gate that finally obstructed him. Beyond it, he made
                out what seemed like a beach town. Perhaps he could rest there for a bit before
                making his way back to that damned&nbsp;hotel. But then again, perhaps not. The things that Hans 
                desired were seldom within easy reach.</p>

                <p>In front of the gate stood a man in uniform. Right next to him was a plaque,
                etched into which were the words, IF CAPTAIN IS ABSENT, CAKE IS ON US. And right
                under that was a single slice of red velvet cake.</p>

                <p>“Ooh, it’s going to start burning soon,” the man said, pointing to the shower
                cap on his head. “If it isn’t too much trouble, could you mark your name in this
                book?”</p>

                <p>He was a burly man with wide shoulders and a chest so large and flat that one
                could easily cook a meal for four on it. His eyes, round and blood-soaked, were
                twice the size of his head. His head was twice the size of his nose. His nose was
                twice the size of his mouth.</p>

                <p>“Chop chop. I don’t have all day. Name. Book. Now!” It was less a book and more
                a collection of coffee-stained pages, barely held together with plastic tape. “I’d
                do it myself if I could,” he continued. “Orders from above, alas.”</p>

                <p>Hans opened the book to its first page and began scanning the entries one by one,
                looking for his name. The letters, while mostly legible, were written in varying
                sizes. The entries had no line breaks between them.</p>

                <p>“I’m having a hard time reading these names,” Hans said. “Is there a reason why
                they are written this way?”</p>

                <p class='footnote2-link'>“Ooh, we only get the one pen and fifty-page pad a year, so we 
                optimize for space. Letters that have a higher probability of occurring are written using 
                less ink and are hence smaller in size.” The guard kept flicking his eyes from side to side, 
                as if to check on that solitary slice of cake.</p>

                <p>“Come on, now! I’ll need to wash this lye out of my hair pretty
                quickly. I got me a date tonight, you see. And my good looks and that scrumptious dessert 
                are my tickets to glory.”</p>

                <p>“Adler, Aigner, Anderson,” Hans began reading in a soft voice.</p>

                <p><i>Pop, pop, sizzle</i>. “Oh my, oh my,” the guard cried. A few puffs of smoke
                emerged from underneath the shower cap.</p>

                <p>“Andert, Andres, Antone,” Hans continued.</p>

                <p><i>Sizzle, pop, sizzle</i>. “Oh no, oh no,” the guard whimpered. By now, fingernail 
                shavings were darting out of the sides of his mouth and piercing the board behind him.</p>

                <p>“Give me your last name, boy.”</p>

                <p>“Nemec.”</p>

                <p>The guard grabbed the book, slammed it shut and then flipped it open to its
                middle. He gripped it with his massive hands and began to slowly tear the book in
                half, down the spine, as satisfyingly as one might peel an aging, bumpy scab. As
                his turnip of a head emerged from behind the parting pages, he had a look on his
                face that commanded respect, and eyes that spoke to Hans. Eyes that whispered, ‘This
                is how I roll.’ He put some plastic tape along the edges of one of the halves and
                handed Hans the bundle.</p>

                <p>“They are sorted alphabetically. By last name.”</p>

                <p class='footnote3-link'>Hans took the now smaller book and flipped through its pages 
                until he got to the Ns. Nemec, Nemec, Nemec. The squinting was doing his head in. It was 
                then that he heard a tremendously loud pop and witnessed a spectacular phenomenon of nature. 
                One that he had hitherto only heard of from travellers from far-away lands.</p>

                <p>The guard’s entire head of hair stood up on all fours and flip-turned off the 
                man’s scalp and onto the ground!</p>

                <p>“My hair! My silky smooth hair, all gone! All gone because of you,
                you snail of a man!”</p>

                <p>“I’m terribly sorry, it’s just that I’m a bit slow on the uptake,” Hans said,
                trying to salvage the situation. The emasculated man’s countenance turned grim.</p>

                <p>“Men, take him away—” Two guards approached Hans and held onto
                his arms. “And blast that Seth Rogen laugh track into his ears.”</p>

                <p>The guards froze in&nbsp;place. “Captain, he is but a boy,” one of them protested, as he ever 
                so slightly loosened his grip. “Solitary confinement is punishment enough.”</p>

                <p>“Silence!” the captain replied, holding back his tears. “Let him suffer.” With
                that, he buried his face in his hands and ran into the trees.</p>

                <p>Hans turned to the velvet cake. “I suppose I can claim that slice now?” The guard to his left 
                replied with a smack upside the head.</p>

                <p>If Hans wanted to stand any chance of getting out of this place, he had to stop making grown 
                men cry.</p>

                <p></p>

                <p class='no-indent'><span class='opening-letter'>J</span>oan’s disappearance was a tragedy 
                for her pet Macau. For everyone else, it was a non-event. <!-- Joan had had the misfortune of

                being surrounded by people who didn’t really like her, but were around her, all the same.</p>

                <p>The wild currents made the journey seem like it would never end. At long last, the boat came to a 
                halt on the sandy beach of an adjacent island. The guards climbed out of the boat and grabbed 
                Hans by the lapels as he followed suit.</p>

                <p>A voice, apparently from the heavens, shook every bone in Hans’ body.</p>

                <p>“Oy! Who are you!”

                <p>It seemed too colloquial a phrase to be transcendent, although the ethnic 
                accent was swinging it a bit.</p>

                <p>Hans opened his eyes to the sight of a gigantic head looking straight at him. For Hans, 
                there was nothing more terrifying than the thought, or in this case the sight,
                of a gigantic head. His mother had informed him time and again, particularly
                when she would find the need to summon her maternal weapon of choice, that the ginger-haired 
                boy had been born a single gigantic head, with little arms and feet sticking out of it.</p>

                <p>Occasional spices included the observation that it was a miracle that Hans was able to make it 
                out of the birth canal without punching a hole through his mother’s bladder. Generally speaking, 
                the amount of embellishment depended on the chore that was being asked of the young boy.</p>

                <p>Hans backed away, trying to make sense of where he was. The head belonged to a red-haired 
                woman in a beige dress. A woman whose eyes were as blue as the waves on which Hans had just 
                voyaged, and whose face was adorned with a band of freckles from one ear to the other.</p>

                <p>“Careful,” she said. “Don’t move too fast or you’ll fall off.” Hans looked down. He
                was standing on the edge of what seemed to be a giant leaf.</p>

                <p>“Where am I? The last thing I remember is being on a boat and coming into
                shore.”</p>

                <p>“Cave, guards, boat, then being shot out of a cannon into this place, right?
                Yeah, been there. It was a while back. I woke up and found myself on top of this 
                gigantic pitcher plant. I couldn’t think of a safe way to escape, so I stayed put, 
                living off of beetles, flies and, on a good day, nectar that’s high enough to reach.”</p>

                <p>“What’s a pitcher plant?”</p>

                <p class='pic4-link'>“Come here, look. Look into that abyss. Do you see that purple juice?” 
                Hans nodded. “That’s the belly of the beast. That cavity holds caustic liquid that the plant
                uses to digest its prey. It lures unsuspecting insects by giving off a scent that
                they recognize as yummy goodness. Once they get here, they’re only a slip away from
                falling in, and then <i>adios</i>.”</p>

                <p>“So for all this time you’ve been living on the edge of this dangerous plant?”</p>

                <p>“Indeed I have. Escape is futile, what with the hard Earth beneath us and all
                those other carnivorous plants salivating at the thought of gulping a morsel like
                me whole. Not to mention that the giant <i>Powelliphantas</i>&mdash;deadly land snails to
                you common folk&mdash;that live in and around this area are quite aggressive. And even if
                I could jump onto that stem down there, I’d slip right off.”</p>

                <p>“How did this one grow to be so big?”</p>

                <p>“Beats me. By the way, my name is Joan,” she said as she offered Hans her
                hand.</p>

                <p>“It’s a pleasure. Hans. How did you end up here, Joan? Were you also swallowed by a 
                puffer fish in a fedora?”</p>

                <p>Joan put one hand on her forehead and pressed her eyes shut, as though calling to
                mind the events of a long time past.</p>

                <p>“Well, I was in the vicinity of water. That’s for sure. I had just necked two
                pints of Ovaltine and so I excused myself and went into the restroom. I must have
                passed out there. I was at the peak of my career, you know. Unstoppable, ambitious,
                confident. Arrogant, actually. Pride goeth before destruction, as they say.</p>

                <p>“We threw this lavish reception in our college’s atrium in honor of Dr. Lee who
                had just donated three million dollars for a new state-of-the-art entomology lab. I
                was there one minute, all dressed up, wafting between immaculately groomed guests.
                Then here. I stormed out of that cave and walked right up to the guards and gave them 
                an earful. As it turns out, they don’t take too kindly to candor.”</p>

                <p>Hans bit his lips. “But there must be a way to get out. I do not suppose anyone would 
                want to spend the rest of his life here. Trapped in a cage with death. Granted, 
                it is pristine. But a cage, nonetheless.”</p>

                <p>“True, things up here are a bit more discernible.” She twiddled her toes to
                scare away a group of flies that were circling close by, then looked up.</p>

                <p>“If you really want to escape, then there’s one way that might, that just might, work. 
                There are these Asian hornets that stop by every morning. They take a nibble of anything 
                that may be trapped in the liquid down below and fly off, with the plant none the wiser. 
                They’re quite dangerous and have a sting that’ll make even the mightiest of people weep. 
                The larger ones are usually less perceptive, though they are sedentary.</p>

                <p class='pic4-zoom-link'>“So my idea is this. We find a way to lure one of those bigger hornets to the
                plant, then once it has its nibble, you jump onto its backs and fly away to safety.
                At the top of that mountain that’s shaped like a banker’s heart lives a popular man.
                He will probably know how to get you off this island once and for all. Be wary of
                his associate though, a man so cynical and whose words are so laden with subtext
                that he has devolved into a sort of mandrill-like creature. He lives on maggots and
                lice that he picks from his skin and endures a perpetual allergy to life. No fool
                doth he suffer well!”</p>

                <p>Looking towards the east at the mountain, Hans made out what seemed like, well,
                what seemed like an eyeglass repair shop. “Is that a shop up there?”</p>

                <p>“Indeed it is. That’s where the supposedly great man lives.”</p>

                <p>The conversation had uplifted Hans’ spirits and lowered his guard. Emboldened, 
                he proceeded in an uncharacteristic manner. He was in uncharted territory. He had broken
                new ground and anything could happen.</p>

                <p>“Why does he live in an eyeglass repair shop? I suppose&mdash;“ Hans cleared his throat and 
                straightened his back. “I suppose it’s to blend in with the other shops in the area.” Hans 
                waited, but Joan did not laugh. He then waited some more. “Tell me, Joan, what makes him a great 
                man?”</p>

                <p>“They say it’s because he is a thinker.”</p>

                <p>“A thinker, you say. Well—umm—what exactly does he do?”</p>

                <p>“He thinks, silly. Personally, I’m doubtful of that sort of thing. I don’t believe there are 
                any experts in life. Just people with different levels of self-doubt.”</p>

                <p>“How do you suppose we’d be able to get one of those bigger hornets to approach
                the plant?”</p>

                <p>“By making the plant give off a stronger than usual scent. The word on the vine is 
                that the strength of the scent is a function of the vapidness of the feast on offer.”</p>

                <p>“I guess the other question is how do we get the plant to eat something that
                would give off that kind of scent?” Hans held his breath as he saw in Joan’s eyes what
                it was she was contemplating. “Joan, you hardly know me.”</p>

                <p>“Someone enters your life passingly and does something unexpected and you wonder
                what would have become of you were it not for them. Life is ephemeral, Hans. I’d rather run 
                after death and grab it by the neck than surrender to it in old age.</p>

                <p>“The hornets fly back home to the east after breakfast. Once you get to the
                river with the giant lilies, jump onto them. They will cushion your fall. From
                there, make your way to the mountain on the other side of the forest, then up to
                the Thinker’s shop.</p>

                <p>“The forest is full of deadly predators that come out at night looking for warm bodies 
                to stuff their bellies with. I can’t be certain of these details, but I have it on good 
                authority that they’re accurate. Those fireflies sure love to kick back and gossip every night.”</p>

                <p>As kind as the offer was, Hans couldn’t accept it. “I’m terribly sorry,
                Joan, but your idea seems a tad too extreme. How could I possibly live with
                myself?”</p>

                <p>“Yeah, I suppose you’re right.”</p>

                <p class='footnote4-link'>“Listen, I brought along this book that I picked up at the train 
                station. It’s about a symbologist trying to crack some code. This <i>ought</i> to have the
                desired effect.”</p>

                <p>Joan looked at the cover and pursed her lips. “Yeah, a few pages of that ought to 
                do the job.”</p>

                <p>“Let’s leave together,” Hans pleaded. “It will be an adventure.”</p>

                <p>“Oh, don’t worry about me. You’ll make it if you believe in yourself.
                Don’t be drawn into the myth of your own inadequacy.”</p>

                <p>“I don’t want to just make it,” Hans replied, faintly.</p>

                <p>“Oh, very well then,” she said a few moments later. “You soft-hearted fool! We make 
                our move tomorrow morning!”</p>

                <p>Hans couldn’t make sense of what seemed like Joan’s conflicting set of ideals. It
                was as though he had caught her amidst a transition from one mindset to another,
                during which liminal period, internal misalignments take on the appearance 
                of&nbsp;contradictions.</p>

                <p></p>

                <p class='no-indent'><span class='opening-letter'>A</span>s the hornet buzzed towards 
                the east, Hans held onto its furry back, tight as he could, looking down at a spectacular 
                view. A carpet of lush, green trees covered most of the island. There was a large hill 
                to the west with half a dozen wild cats resting on its peak. Right below that, a silky 
                white beach stretched between the foothills and the sparkling turquoise water. One of 
                the cats lay on the grass, belly up, not a care in the world. Like a capsized Budai, 
                modulo the smile of course. And the contentment, one might suppose. And the affection, one 
                might&nbsp;imagine.</p>

                <p>“Look, over there.” Joan tapped Hans on the shoulder and pointed straight ahead.
                “That’s the river with the lilies. On three now. One-two-jump!”</p>

                <p>Hans flapped his arms like a scared chicken and filled the heavens with frantic sounds 
                of flipping, turning, shouting and screaming. He hit one of the lilies with a thud and let 
                out a formidable fart. As that civilization of methane escaped into the ether, the tailor was 
                comforted by the thought of vicarious freedom. He was peculiar like that.</p>

                <p>Joan scrambled onto the riverbank. Hans followed suit.</p>

                <p>“Well, this is it,” she said.</p>

                <p>Hans glanced up and around. To the east, the mountain rose up against the sky. His
                visceral thought was to go with the simplest strategy, which was to walk towards
                the mountain in as straight a line as possible. There was no time to waste. Joan
                agreed, and the two entered the maze of trees.</p>

                <p>“Hey, look at this,” she said. Nailed to the tree in front of them was what appeared to 
                be a map. Joan tore off the aging piece of cloth with one hand and inspected it.</p>

                <p>“Time for Plan B, Hans.” The map was littered with spots labeled DANGEROUS
                and STAY AWAY along with drawings of skulls, crossbones and former vice presidents.
                “We’re not going to want to risk going anywhere near those places.”</p>

                <p>“Oh no, we’re going to be supper for a herd of hungry wild cats,” Hans said. “There
                are so many possible combinations, with numerous forks along several of those
                paths. We’re&nbsp;doomed.”</p>

                <p>“Will you get a grip? How did you make it this far in life with that kind of
                attitude? Now look here. The larger trees are connected with dotted lines and
                along each dotted line is a number, in minutes. The only problem is that longer
                paths don’t always take longer to traverse. In fact—see this—the longest path
                reportedly takes the shortest amount of time to cross.” She pointed to the
                footnote.</p>

                <p>“Lions graze here, traveller—run,” Hans read.</p>

                <p>“That wrinkle will likely make it difficult for us to visually determine the
                shortest path.”</p>

                <p class='footnote5-link'>“Perhaps if we always take the shortest path from each tree to 
                the next. That seems reasonable enough, don’t you think?”</p>

                <p>“Well, let’s see, that would take—umm—around eight hours.” She looked up at the
                sky. “It’s around noon now. The sun sets at half-past-six. Eight hours is too
                long.”</p>

                <p>Drops of sweat trickled down Hans’ forehead. He sat down on the ground and cradled 
                his head in his sweaty palms.</p>

                <p>“We’re finished!” He closed his eyes to the near-immediate sight of Aunt
                Jennifer. This time she was holding onto a rolling pin and slowly tapping the tip
                of her shoulder with it. For someone named after the patron saint of disasters, Aunt 
                Jennifer had the uncanny ability to show up at disasters and make them worse.</p>

                <p>Hans stood up, his eyes still shut. “I will not perish!” he screamed, pointing towards 
                the sky and whatever lay beyond it. “I will make it out of here. If it’s the last thing 
                I ever—”</p>

                <p><i>Bam!</i></p>

                <p>Something hit that faint-hearted traveller right on the side of his head, then fell 
                and cracked open near his feet. His vision swam and vertigo overcame him.</p>

                <p>“What on Earth was that?” he said, with one hand on his forehead, and the other 
                holding onto his glasses. And then he heard tutting. Could it be? Was he in London?</p>

                <p class='pic5-link'>As Hans’ eyesight refocused, he looked up and saw a group of onlookers dressed 
                only in white briefs, perched on a branch. They hefted coconuts and rolled their eyes. The sole human 
                among them was wrapped in a sunburnt cloak of oily skin. His shiny bald head made him appear 
                like a celestial figure&mdash;an image slightly dampened by the lightly smeared white briefs.</p>

                <p>“Who are you?” Hans shouted.</p>

                <p>“A cenobite from the Singuado monastery. We are all cenobites. We took an oath of 
                silence seventy suppers ago to trounce our persistent dependence on tutting. Your sobbing
                distressed us so much that we snapped. Oh, how I’ve missed it. I’ve got so much
                tutting to catch up on.”</p>

                <p>Joan chuckled. “That’s just what you needed, Hans. A coconut to the head to shut
                you up.” It was the very first time that Hans had seen Joan smile.</p>

                <p>He had an interesting idiolect, that old tutter on the tree. A lisp, of sorts,
                most probably caused by the way his lips were perched up and to one side, as though
                they were an autonomous being about to lift off and embark on a flight into the
                heavens. With every <i>thilenthe</i> and <i>thnapped</i>, Hans was treated to an
                onslaught of warm, viscous saliva. Fearless kamikaze globules that darted towards
                his face, their hearts atop their armor.</p>

                <p>“Hey, you. Captain Underwear,” Joan said. “You must have a good view from up
                there. We’re trying to get to that mountain before sunset.” Her statement led to an
                outbreak of tutting amongst the tutters’ ranks.</p>

                <p>“A simple person you must be to ask such a simple question. Is it not self-evident
                what the quickest route is?”</p>

                <p>“Now look here, friend, don’t you get all smart with me&mdash;”</p>

                <p>“Your friend?” he interrupted. “Me, virtuous and scholarly, a friend of a 
                feckless&nbsp;cretin?”</p>

                <p>“That explains why you’re missing the tip of your nose then.” Joan curtsied and
                wobbled her head in a silly way, before adding, “Your Grace.”</p>

                <p>“That was uncalled for. I lost my nose many years ago. It was calamitous,” the
                Tutter&nbsp;countered. “I was being chased by several assassins when they struck. It was 
                cataclysmically catastrophic.”</p>

                <p>Upon closer inspection, both Hans and Joan realized that the man was indeed missing a 
                large chunk of his nose. Now, less animated, he said, “Here, take a look at this. Whenever you
                are stuck on a problem in life, it is not a bad idea to inspect the corpus of human
                knowledge. There is a good chance that other people have encountered the same
                roadblock before and managed to overcome it.”</p>

                <p class='footnote6-link'>The Tutter dropped a stapled collection of papers towards Hans. It 
                floated down and landed on the ground, immediately soaking up its dampness like a sponge. Hans 
                picked up the stack and paged through it. An academic paper, whose content was
                mercifully shorter than its title.</p>

                <p>Recalling his recent encounter with the guard, Hans made sure not to make assumptions. 
                A wrong assumption now could mean death or worse&mdash;being stuck with the&nbsp;tutters.</p>

                <p>“Excuse me, the method outlined in here, will it get us to the mountain before&nbsp;sunset?”</p>

                <p>“Yes, perhaps the first one will.”</p>

                <p>Hans handed the short document to Joan, but she insisted that he go through it and
                report back. She said she had to get a few things. Hans took the time to go through
                the first method in the document and saw that its suggestion was an improvement over his original 
                solution.</p>

                <p>He had been blinding himself from potentially better paths by always
                assuming that a shorter path in the beginning implied a shorter overall one, which
                of course isn’t always the case.</p>

                <p class='footnote7-link'>Using this new method, he would start at the first tree and look at 
                all of the possible paths to neighboring trees and make a note of the time that it took to get to each 
                one. He would then, in turn, do that for each of those neighboring trees, starting with the ones 
                that he could get to the quickest, and so on until he covered the entire set of trees. If it was his 
                first time crossing a tree or if a previous visit had resulted in a longer recorded time, he would 
                scratch out the old time and make note of the newer, shorter time.</p>

                <p>The suggested route to the mountain would get them there in six hours.</p>

                <p>Satisfied with the now higher likelihood of making it through the forest before
                sundown, Hans folded the paper and slid it into his back pocket. He waved to Joan. She
                was a few yards away behind some bushes. “Hey, Joan. I think we got our Plan&nbsp;B.”</p>

                <p>She walked back, carrying what seemed like a bunch of rocks and leaves.</p>

                <p>“What’s that?” he asked.</p>

                <p>“Preemption. I’m going to have to fix up my dress, in case we have to leg
                it!”</p>

                <p>“Well, you’re in luck,” Hans replied, with a smile. “That’s the one thing I’m
                quite good at.”</p>

                <p></p>

                eyeglass repair shop open until the hinges creaked. There before him was the cynic he 
                had been forewarned of. That ghastly creature who knew the price of everything and the 
                value of nothing. He sat on the floor, stony-faced, against a dusty wall. One would have 
                thought that the sight of a physically drained man drenched in sweat, gasping for breath, 
                would evoke a more hospitable welcome.</p>

                <p>Hans felt Joan’s elbow poking him in the ribs. He took a step forward.</p>

                <p>It would perhaps not be uncharitable to say that the Mandrill had a unique face. His eyes 
                were droopy, but only just, as though his eyelids had decided to drop, then discovered that 
                it would be too taxing a task. His mouth, no less perplexing, appeared to be frowning,
                smiling and mocking, all at the same time. The ensuing sneer was so patience-testing that one 
                wouldn’t have been surprised if it turned out that the Mandrill was actually a presenter on a 
                major news&nbsp;channel.</p>

                <p>“I suppose you’re here for the Wi-Fi?” he said, sniffing.</p>

                <p>“Wi-Fi? Umm—no, we’re here to see the Thinker,” Hans replied, assuming the body
                language of a man of moderate self-confidence.</p>

                <p>Joan had run out of patience. “We’ve travelled all day through the forest,
                racing against a setting sun and evading wild predators and booby traps. We’ve
                walked up hundreds of flights of stairs, risking our lives with every step. Lead us
                to him at once,&nbsp;Mandrill!”</p>

                <p>The Mandrill looked at Joan without saying a word. His hands were clasped
                together in his lap. Every couple of seconds, he would twirl his thumbs about each
                other. After what seemed like the better part of a minute had passed, he opened his
                mouth.</p>

                <p>“Why do you want to see the Thinker? So you can take a selfie with him and
                exchange it for Facebook <i>likes</i> and Internet <i>karma</i>? I know your type. The Thinker
                doesn’t have time to socialize with visitors. The little free time he does have, he
                prefers to spend it in the company of smart people, a list of whom I have here.” He
                pointed to a pile of papers that rested against the wall beside him.</p>

                <p class='footnote8-link'>“Umm&mdash;is there any way you might be able to add us to 
                that list?” Hans asked.</p>

                <p>The Mandrill turned his gaze to Hans. Without raising his right hand, he pointed to 
                the adjacent wall. “Have a seat.” Hans walked to the wall and sat down, as did Joan.</p>

                <p>He poured Hans a glass of a shiny red liquid. “Have a sip of this artisanal
                Kool-Aid. It will calm your nerves.” Hans did just that, and as though by magic, he was 
                overcome with the pressing desire to create a mobile app. He didn’t even know what a mobile
                app was.</p>

                <p>“Let me introduce myself,” the Mandrill said. “My name is Kolon. Dr. Blok D. Kolon.” He 
                raised his hands as a magician would after a particularly clever trick. “I run this
                place. Don’t be fooled by the corridors paved with slime and the flaky walls. We do
                a lot of valuable research and development here. We’re in stealth mode at the moment. Hence 
                the disguised exterior.”</p>

                <p>Joan sighed and undid her hair.</p>

                <p>The Mandrill continued. “This is an intellectually sterile environment, so we want to be 
                careful who we let in. Your general appearance tells me that you’re probably not cut out for this
                place. How about you come back in a few years time when you’re more experienced?”</p>

                <p>“What exactly would I want to become more experienced in?” Hans said.</p>

                <p>“A priori knowledge of&mdash;things.”</p>

                <p>“Things? What things in particular?”</p>

                <p>“All the things.”</p>

                <p>“That’s well and good,” Hans said. “But we really need to see the Thinker, and
                pretty soon. I’m not too sure that we can afford to wait for a few years.” He
                glanced at Joan. “Can you do anything?” he mouthed to her. She shrugged.</p>
                
                <p>“Let’s get out of here, Hans.”</p>

                <p>Hans looked at Kolon. “Just so you know, the thought of taking a selfie with the Thinker 
                did cross my mind.” Joan turned the knob and walked out.</p>

                <p>“Wait,” Kolon said, as Hans was about to close the door behind him. Hans popped
                his head back into the shop. “There’s a campsite at the bottom of this rock.
                Every now and then, I see smoke billowing from there. Just saying.”</p>

                <p>“Hey Joan, I found us a place to rest tonight. Apparently, there’s a campsite at
                the bottom.”</p>

                <p>“Sounds like a plan, Hans. But first, come and have a seat. Let’s soak this
                in.”</p>

                <p>Hans and Joan sat at the edge of the mountain and looked at the majestic view before 
                them. At that glorious orange disc in the sky, edging its way towards the horizon. The
                heavens were calm. Quiet. Serene.</p>

                <p></p>

                <p class='no-indent'><span class='opening-letter'>B</span>y the time Hans and Joan reached 
                the mountain’s foot, the sun had all but set. As night fell, the two travellers became engulfed 
                in pitch darkness, yet they walked. No sooner had Hans entangled himself in a bad analogy about 
                a fetus in a womb than he heard sniffing and scratching. He proceeded slowly until his view was 
                unobstructed. It was a dog. A fox terrier in fact.</p>

                <p>“Shoo,” he whispered to the the fluffy white animal as he flicked his hands at him.
                The dog just stood there, looking at Hans, eyebrows raised.</p>

                <p>“Leave him alone.” Joan walked up to the dog and scratched him behind the
                ears. Hans approached. The dog leapt out of Joan’s arms and ran into the trees.</p>

                <p>“I guess he doesn’t like you,” Joan said. She picked up a dusty bone from the
                ground, one that the terrier was likely munching on, and threw it towards the trees. The terrier 
                darted out from behind the bushes, scooped up the bone with his tongue and then dashed back. 
                Hans walked towards a nook in the mountain and rested against the smooth slab of rock. Joan was 
                moving about, gathering things. Smelling
                and tasting them.</p>

                <p>“What are you doing?”</p>

                <p>“If we want to stay warm tonight, and fend off unwelcome guests, we’ll need to
                light a fire.”</p>

                <p>Hans crossed his hands behind his head. In the darkness, he could just about make out where 
                the terrier was hiding. He took out a chocolate bar from his jacket and broke off a small piece.</p>

                <p>“Here, doggy,” he said as he threw the block of chocolate towards the trees. The dog didn’t 
                wait long, jumping as he did towards the piece and gulping it down whole. He took a step
                forward and then began a cervine walk towards Hans, stopping every so often and
                looking around. When he was close enough, Hans broke off another piece of chocolate and
                placed it in the dog’s mouth.</p>

                <p>“I see you’re friends now,” Joan said. She was rubbing two twigs against each other and 
                blowing into a recess that she had made in the ground.</p>

                <p>“Indeed. Little, umm&mdash;Pavlov, yes, that’s what I’ll call him. Pavlov here sure
                likes chocolate.”</p>

                <p>“You gave chocolate to a dog? Get it out of his belly right away! For heaven’s
                sake. Who gives chocolate to a dog!”</p>

                <p class='footnote9-link'>Hans remembered that during a particularly lonely summer’s day, 
                back when he was a schoolboy, he had tasked a neighbor with tickling him for so long that 
                the activity had led to immediate bowel action. That ought to work.</p>

                <p>He grabbed the poor soul and positioned him on his back. The dog looked into Hans’ eyes 
                as he descended on the innocent chap. <i>Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle</i>. The dog raised one 
                eyebrow and lowered the other. As though to say, &lsquo;Human, what on Earth is wrong with you?&rsquo;</p>

                <p>Joan had by now started the fire and was cozying up to it. Hans continued his noble pursuit. 
                Ten minutes must have passed and then, without a perfunctory warning of any kind, the
                terrier let out a loud burp and unleashed a pint of warm belly juice into Hans’ face.</p>

                <p>“Argh! It burns!”</p>

                <p>Hans fell to the ground and rolled around until the stickiness of the smelly vomit
                had been replaced with the choking powdery feel of dust. He opened his eyes not to
                the sight of his comrade, holding his head in her lap, wiping his forehead with a warm
                towel, giving him words of encouragement&mdash;Hans watched a lot of soap operas, you 
                see&mdash;but rather, to said comrade looking intently at a piece of laminated paper.</p>

                <p>“What’s that?” he asked, wiping off the dust and dirt from his clothes and sitting up.</p>

                <p>“It came out of the dog. It seems like it’s, well&mdash;it seems like it’s a business 
                card.”</p>

                <p>“What does it say?”</p>

                <p>“Walter Jones, NSA Agent.”</p>

                <p>“NSA? Nordic Scrabble Association?”</p>

                <p>“No, Hans. National Security Agency. You know, monitoring, counterintelligence,
                enhanced interrogation techniques. That sort of thing.”</p>

                <p>“Oh. Oh, I see. Why would an NSA agent be in a place like this?”</p>

                <p>“More importantly, why did your friend here swallow his business card?” Joan
                looked at the puddle on the ground. She bent down and, with the force of a suburban 
                parent disciplining their child, she picked up a round object.</p>

                <p>“Whoa. Is that a button?” Joan nodded.</p>

                <p>“Pavlov, where did you find this?” The dog barked and ran towards the trees,
                wagging his tail. He turned his head and saw that his human friends hadn’t moved. He 
                barked again.</p>

                <p>“There’s no way we’re leaving now,” Joan said. “It’s too dangerous. Let’s get
                some rest and make our move in the morning.” Hans pantomimed the plan to Pavlov.</p>

                <p>The dog walked back to the nook with Hans and cuddled up beside him. Joan slept a 
                few feet away. It wasn’t too long before everyone dozed off. For it had been a long day.</p>

                <p></p>

                <p class='no-indent'><span class='opening-letter'>T</span>he next morning, Hans, Joan and 
                Pavlov ventured into the trees until they encountered a jumbled pile of mismatched apparel. 
                Beige corduroy trousers and a blue jacket. <!--How terribly transatlantic.--> The corpse 
                underneath was of course equally disturbing. A yard or so away lay a coconut covered in 
                gunk. Joan approached the spot, treading ever so lightly.</p>

                <p>“It’s&mdash;a man,” she said. “A man in a suit.”</p>

                <p>“Is he asleep?”</p>

                <p>“Well, he is missing half his torso. I mean there is that. But otherwise he’s in
                pretty good shape.”</p>

                <p>“Oh. So he’s asleep then?”</p>

                <p>“Ha! You’re not going to believe this, Hans. Look.”</p>

                <p>Hans examined the slip of paper that Joan had in her hand. “Hey, it’s a picture of that 
                blocked colon guy!” he said. “A selfie with the Mandrill. Well, what do you know.”</p>

                <p>“Whatever this guy’s connection to the Mandrill is, I bet you he’s on his list.”
                Joan’s eyes grew wider.</p>

                <p>“Are you thinking what I’m thinking?” Hans took a moment to compose himself.</p>

                <p>“I’ll be honest with you, Joan. Somehow I doubt it.”</p>

                <p>“You become Walter Jones,” she said, elongating every syllable of the
                decomposing man’s name.</p>

                <p>Hans scratched his head. “You mean in spirit?”</p>

                <p>“No. I mean you put on his jacket and shades and you go to the Mandrill pretending to be 
                Walter Jones. It’s worth a shot. Pavlov and I will wait for you at the campsite. How about that?”</p>

                <p>“Sounds like a plan.” Joan handed Hans the slip of paper.</p>

                <p>“Come on, Pavlov. Reconnaissance time.”</p>

                <p>Hans took off his jacket and slipped into Walter Jones’ jacket. He then popped on the shades. 
                When they all reached the campsite, Joan wished him luck and they went their separate ways.</p>

                <p class='footnote10-link'>Hoodwinking the Mandrill was a quick affair. He looked up briefly, 
                figured that his visitor was actually Walter, and then allowed Hans to go through to the back. Hans 
                walked under the arch of Detoxia&mdash;named after the Greek god of charlatanism&mdash;through the 
                corridor of Halitosis&mdash;named after the Greek god of indigestion&mdash;and finally reached the 
                wall of Moostafa, which had been christened so for ironic reasons.</p>

                <p>“The code is still the same,” the Mandrill shouted from across the corridor. “86-75-30-9.” 
                The Mandrill happened to be enchanted with prime numbers and obscure pop culture references.</p>
                
                <p>There in the back, sitting flush with the wall was a large  door with a combination lock and 
                lever guarding it. Hans dialed the combination lock. It clicked. He took a deep breath and 
                straightened his back. He would have to go in poised, self-assured, dignified.</p>

                <p>He pulled the lever and unleashed a puff of clammy air that smacked him square in the 
                face. It fogged up his glasses. As the moisture on Hans’ second pair of eyes slowly receded, 
                he saw that three rows of steel pipes obstructed the top of the entrance. He held onto the wall 
                for support and lowered his head. Crawling might have been the better option. It’s just that, in 
                Hans’ experience, there appeared to be an inverse relationship between how close his face was to 
                the ground and the favorability with which others perceived him.</p>

                <p>He was inside. When he got to the end of the entrance, he raised his head, and lo and 
                behold, there actually was a human being there. The magnificent Thinker whom he had heard so much about. 
                The person whom he had been searching for. Encased, embalmed you might say, inside that tiny
                steel room. That gamy room.</p>

                <p>The Thinker was sitting on a wide chair, arms extended along the armrests, His eyes fixed 
                on the wall straight ahead, as though the whole weight of the universe rested on His shoulders.</p>

                <p class='pic8-link'>The Thinker was a thin, pasty man with a full head of grey hair. He had thick, bushy eyebrows and 
                a pair of heavy eyes. He wore a brown suit, a brown waistcoat and a brown bowtie. To Hans, it was a 
                splendid sight. The Thinker looked perfect in every sense of the word. Divine.</p>

                <p>“It’s an honor to finally meet you. I was told that you, of all people, would be able to give me 
                direction and guidance.”</p>

                <p>Hans sensed that the man was about to open his mouth, so he lowered his 
                gaze. Nothing happened. Hans looked up and saw that the man was still thinking. He lowered his gaze 
                again. Again, nothing happened. Hans fidgeted a bit then looked up at the man once more. Could it be that 
                this beautiful creature was, quite literally, a thinker, in that He wasn’t capable of doing anything 
                other than thinking?</p>

                <p>“Umm, sorry to bother you, but are you able to hear the words that are coming out of my mouth?” 
                Nothing.</p>

                <p>“Would you mind nodding if you can hear me?” Nothing.</p>

                <p>“If you can can see me?” Nothing. Hans took out the piece of paper that had the photo of Walter 
                and the Mandrill on it and held it up to him.</p>

                <p>“Look, this is me. It’s ok. I’m intelligent.” Nothing.</p>

                <p>So it was then. Hans had finally found the one person whom he had thought could help
                him, only to be disappointed. The Thinker was a being so absolute that, in actuality,
                He had no practical value. A corpse covered in honey.</p>

                <p>Hans walked out, Joseph Merrick-style, as before, and stood there, unsure of how to
                proceed. He was just about to put the photo back in his jacket pocket when he noticed
                something. The moisture in the room had weakened the paper causing the corners to 
                curve outward. It was in fact two pieces of paper stuck together. Hans peeled the sheets apart. 
                The one concealed underneath the photo was blank, except for a small red cross in one corner. 
                How odd. He folded both papers and put them back in his pocket.</p>

                <p></p>

                <p class='no-indent'><span class='opening-letter'>S</span>ave for a torn piece of Joan’s dress, 
                Hans’ two companions were nowhere to be seen. He was back at the campsite.</p>

                <p>“Joan, Pavlov, where are you?” Hans was on the verge of panicking, and so, like a protagonist 
                in a Hollywood war movie, he ran into the trees, screaming at the enemy and waving his 
                hands around. To his disappointment, the laws of nature did not bend in his favor.</p>

                <p>The unguided walk through the trees was proving to no avail. Hans’ comrades were nowhere to 
                be seen.</p>

                <p>“Joan, can you hear me? Jo&mdash;” <i>Tick</i>, and then <i>wham!</i> He felt a loop of
                rope tighten around his right ankle and then propel him upward. Hans suddenly found 
                himself inside a sack of thick ropes, suspended in midair.</p>

                <p>“Oh no, help! Somebody, help!” he screamed. This was bad. This was really bad.
                There was no way things could get any worse.</p>

                <p>It wasn’t long before Hans heard the sound of something moving between the bushes.
                He froze in place and did his best to put a cap on his heavy breathing. Was He being
                hunted?</p>

                <p>It was then that it jumped out from among the trees. Homburg, briefcase and
                all. He saw Hans right away. “Well, well, well. If it isn’t my old pal.”</p>

                <p>Hans let out a groan as the thought of being hurt by this most capricous of beings 
                crossed his mind. “I’ll do anything you want, Mr. McCoy. I’ll help you sell insurance
                plans if that will make you happy. Please don’t hurt me.”</p>

                <p>“I don’t know what you’ve been drinking, son. I’d never hurt you.” He took off his 
                homburg and sat down on a nearby rock.</p>

                <p>“I get it. People have different priorities.” McCoy took a handkerchief out of 
                his homburg, wiped his forehead with it, and then put both the handkerchief and the homburg 
                on his head again.</p>
                
                <p>“Most people get older and they start losing their drive, son. I never did. But I was 
                never too smart to begin with, you see. Still, I like to think of myself as a land not yet 
                plowed. It’s the only way not to abandon hope, you know. I don’t want to be like my old man. 
                A plasterer by day. A janitor by night. Forgotten in death. The poor sod.”</p>

                <p>Hans fidgeted a bit amidst the ropes. “Mr. McCoy, I thought you weren’t good at 
                navigating the forest. You seem to have made it really far.”</p>

                <p>“Luck, son. If you asked me to get here again tomorrow, I wouldn’t have the
                faintest idea. By the way, I’m a bit strapped for cash. Any chance you could lend
                me a few quid?”</p>

                <p>Hans dug into his pockets and found a solitary coin. “This is all I have.”</p>

                <p>“That makes you the most generous man in the world. It’ll come around,” he said
                with a wink.</p>

                <p>“You know what? I bumped into someone a short while after our first encounter,
                and he taught me a really smart way of moving through the forest. Let me tell you
                how it’s done. Better yet, let me give you something to read and you can learn
                about it yourself.”</p>

                <p>“Oh I’m too old to read. Why don’t you just tell me how it’s done?”</p>

                <p>“No, I insist. It’s not that hard, and you’ll be grateful that you did. Thinking for
                yourself forces you to dispel assumptions that you might have otherwise taken as
                read. Trust me, I speak from experience.” Hans took out the paper that the Tutter 
                had given him and waved it at McCoy.</p>

                <p>“Oh, where are my manners. Let me get you down.”</p>

                <p>Once Hans was on the ground, he handed his savior the paper and the map. McCoy opened 
                his briefcase and took out a camera.</p>

                <p>“I’ll take that clever talk, but not the map. You might need it yourself. Let me
                snap a photo of it.”</p>

                <p>And that’s when it hit Hans. A pesky fly. And then it hit him. Why of course. He
                took out the piece of paper that he had discovered right after he came out of the
                Thinker’s room and placed it on top of the map. Through the semi-opaque fiber, he
                noticed that the red cross lay almost exactly on top of the skull and crossbones of
                the map below. How peculiar. What if the predators in the forest were as artificial
                as the Thinker’s abilities? Hans felt his heart rate spike. He said his goodbyes to 
                McCoy and headed out.</p>

                <p>When Hans reached the marked spot, it didn’t seem like there was anything or anyone
                of interest there. But then he noticed, to one side, a convex structure protruding from 
                the ground. Initially, he had thought it a collapsed tree bark, but as he got closer, he saw 
                that it was in fact a hatch. A hatch covered in a mesh made of dry leaves. He pulled one
                end of the mesh and threw it to one side.</p>

                <p>With all the strength that he could muster, he imparted a mighty impulse on the ledge 
                and slowly but surely the door gave way. Hans walked down the steps and found himself in a 
                tiny room no larger than his own tailor shop. A most unassuming room it was.</p>

                <p>In front of Hans was a wooden desk behind which sat a small, grey-haired man in a
                black jacket. He was so utterly and totally consumed with whatever it is that he was doing, 
                muttering things to himself and writing in a notebook, that he did not notice his guest. 
                Hans volunteered to break the awkwardness.</p>

                <p>“Umm&mdash;I don’t mean to be too forward, but&mdash;”</p>

                <p>“Argh!” the man gasped. He took out a long steel rod and pointed it in Hans’
                general direction. “Freeze. Not one step or I will end you. Who are you? Are you
                with them?” It was then that Hans realized that he still had Walter Jones’ jacket 
                on.</p>

                <p>“Oh, do you mean&mdash;no, I’m not an agent if that’s what you mean. My name is Hans.
                I’m a tailor. This is just something I put on in an attempt to get out of here.”
                The man put down the rod.</p>

                <p>“One second. Hans, you say. Where are you from?”</p>

                <p>“Altstadt. It’s a small town in the collapsed state of Dorovia.”</p>

                <p>He opened a filing cabinet that sat beside his desk and fiddled through it for a bit. He 
                took out a paper, read a few lines, looked up at Hans a few times, nodded and put back the
                piece of paper. Then, with the enthusiasm of someone who had just laid eyes on a
                long lost brother, he got up and walked towards Hans. The man placed his hands on Hans’ 
                shoulders and smiled.</p>

                <p>“Sorry about that. You can never be too careful. I’m Alan Bards. Please
                have a seat.”</p>

                <p class='pic9-link'>Hans sat down on the shiny leather chair. Mr. Bards sauntered to the
                hatch door and locked it. “I always forget to do that,” he said as he walked towards 
                the leather chair beside Hans and took a seat.</p>

                <p>Mr. Bards had a round head and several streaks of grey hair poking out of his skull. He 
                wore thick glasses, without which he was practically blind.</p>

                <p>“Now, about this agent. He didn’t have any friends who might have followed you
                here, did he?”</p>

                <p>“Umm&mdash;no. He was actually, how can I put it&mdash;in a pretty deep sleep. We found him 
                in the forest.”</p>

                <p>“It’s getting out of hand, Hans. It’s really getting out of hand.”</p>

                <p>“What is, Mr. Bards?”</p>

                <p>“This whole project. The IRS are on my back because they think I’ve put together 
                this place as a tax haven. Sure, it slipped my mind to declare it on my tax return 
                forms, but I wanted to keep a lid on things until we published our paper. We had a 
                supposedly friendly conversation a few weeks ago, at their behest. Man, were they 
                brutal, dismantling me as they did with such Teutonic ferocity that you’d think we 
                were in a World Cup semifinal. Now everyone is involved. The NSA, the FBI, the 
                Germans, Starbucks.”</p>

                <p>“Starbucks? Have they set up shop here?”</p>

                <p>“It was their UK-based accounting department that was mainly interested in the project.”</p>

                <p>“What exactly is this project?”</p>

                <p>Mr. Bards took a moment to compose his reply. “I wanted to create a world that no longer 
                exists. We got an 80 million dollar grant to teach Computer Science to a broad audience in a novel 
                way. So we collaborated with the NSA who, bless them, already had a global surveillance program going 
                on. They were seeking atonement for past sins, and so they helped us develop a cohort of people who 
                at some point in their recent past had expressed, in speech, in writing or in thought, a wish to 
                learn something entirely new.”</p>

                <p>“Even the Mandrill? He seemed pretty pig-headed.”</p>

                <p>“Aah, well, we did have quite a few false positives. The NSA’s sentiment analysis algorithm, 
                unlike MI6’s, wasn’t able to discriminate between irony and genuine emotion. The ungrateful 
                primate. He's in cahoots with those operatives, would you believe it?</p>

                <p class='footnote11-link'>“In any case, we used sea-creatures as agents and put together 
                this self-contained series of finite worlds, nested within each other like a set of
                matryoshka dolls. Everything you see around you is 3D-printed. Everything.</p>

                <p>“We repurposed the insides of those creatures to support life. It’s all very clever. 
                <i>Big Brother’s Younger Brother</i>. That’s what it’s called. The idea is that you
                learn things indirectly and situationally. The lessons get simpler the deeper you go, and 
                the harder ones, you learn on the way out.”</p>

                <p>“Couldn’t you have just sent us to a training program in some idyllic location,
                like the Seychelles?”</p>

                <p>“I wish we had, Hans. I really wish we had. Frankenstein, that’s what this is. A
                Frankenstein deep in the belly of the Pacific Ocean. I had no idea that humans were
                this non-deterministic and irrational. They seem so civil online.</p>

                <p>“The NSA are pissed off at us for having told a few people about our collaboration with 
                the agency. The deal was supposed to be classified, you see, but we didn’t know any better. 
                Granted, tagging Admiral Rogers on Facebook and asking our followers to &lsquo;big it up for 
                him&rsquo; might have been a step too far. What can I say. We were young and foolish. 
                Well&mdash;we were foolish.</p>

                <p>“Out of spite, they gave the device that shrinks and modifies people’s bodies so that 
                they can survive in this aquatic world to half the planet’s intelligence agencies. All in 
                the hopes of bringing poor old Bards to justice. That’s why I’m hiding in this bunker. I 
                need to figure out my next move.”</p>

                <p>“My two friends are missing, Mr. Bards. Do you know who might have taken them?”</p>

                <p>“Definitely agents. They’re trying to get to me, and anyone they come across is
                seen as a potential lead.”</p>

                <p>“The only way out of this current world&mdash;the deepest one&mdash;is through the 
                fish’s exit passage, which is located in my hideout.” He pointed to a map on the wall 
                and I was able to discern the hideout’s location. “The other exit passages are in
                similar hideouts in the other two outer worlds. They’re manned by my colleagues
                Sebastian and Laura. You’ll want to head out now. If those agents get to the ocean
                with your friends, you’ll probably never see them again.”</p>

                <p>Hans thanked Mr. Bards and got up to leave.</p>

                <p>“Just one question, Mr. Bards. If you don’t mind, that is. Why me? I’m sure
                there were lots of other people who must have fit your selection criteria. Why did
                you pick me?”</p>

                <p>“Well, a teacher might ask a question in class and decide to pick that eager 
                student in the front row to answer it. Another teacher might ask a question and then 
                glance around the room and notice that quiet student in the corner, the one looking away 
                for fear of making eye contact with his teacher, dreading the thought of having to speak 
                up in front of his peers. The teacher hears that dark horse’s racing heart through the 
                sound of his heavy breathing, and knows that that seemingly aloof student is more than 
                meets the eye. And so the teacher calls on the boy, and by doing so, transforms him.”</p>

                <p>Mr. Bards took off his glasses and placed his hand on Hans’ shoulder. “Let me tell 
                you something for nothing, Hans. There’s Einstein in a patent office and then there’s a 
                boiling frog. Here, you can fly by the seat of your pants! Being a cat’s whisker from 
                danger is not a bad place to be in life.”</p>

                <p>Hans thought it an apt sentiment. All the same, he opened the hatch door and left. There 
                was no time to waste.</p>

                <p>Hans got to Mr. Bards’ hideout and found another strip of Joan’s dress right in
                front of the entrance. The lair was bare and so the wrinkly lump that Mr. Bards had told him 
                of wasn’t too difficult to find.</p>

                <p>“Here goes,” he said and then jumped into the unknown. The lack of air knocked him 
                out almost immediately. No Aunt Jennifer this time, though. Progress.</p>

                <p>As Hans’ ears adjusted to the voices of people mumbling in the distance, he realized 
                that he was on a dusty old street. A full moon lit up the houses that lined the
                block and there, near the end of the street, he saw a bustling pub.</p>

                <p>Hans clenched his fists and found himself repeating something that Mr. Bards had mumbled 
                during their recent encounter.</p>

                <p>“There had better be one hell of a T-shirt at the end of all of this.”</p>

                a class of algorithms known as <i>divide-and-conquer</i>. A typical application of 
                divide-and-conquer algorithms is sorting. The metaphor draws on the fact that these algorithms break up 
                a collection of things into smaller and smaller collections, until they can be broken up no more, 
                following which they sort the smallest collections, then the slightly bigger ones, and so on, until 
                the entire collection is sorted.

        <p class='no-indent prose-for-the-reader'>Here are some explanations of a few of the concepts
        that were pointed out in the story.</p>

        <p class='no-indent'>There are typically numerous ways of solving the same problem. Let’s
        start calling those ways <i>algorithms</i>. One method for determining the best algorithm
        to use is to consider two aspects of it: how long it takes to complete and how much space
        it requires. We’ll call the former the algorithm’s runtime complexity and the latter its
        space complexity. Fancy-sounding names, you might have noticed. That’s how we roll. Let us
        now consider how we might evaluate an algorithm based on its runtime&nbsp;complexity.</p>

        <p>An intuitive way of measuring how long an algorithm takes to complete might be to start
        a clock when the algorithm begins running, stop the clock when it’s done and then observe
        the elapsed time. But this method relies on the particular clock that we use, which can
        become a problem. Different machines may have different capabilities and may therefore give
        different readings. A better way of measuring time is to count the number of fundamental
        operations that the algorithm performs. If we’re doing simple arithmetic, for instance,
        these operations might be addition or&nbsp;multiplication.</p>

        <p>Say that you have an algorithm that determines the sum of a set of integers from 1 to
        <i>n</i>. For instance, if n&nbsp;=&nbsp;3, then our sum ought to be 
        1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;6. When we say
        integers, we mean whole numbers, i.e. not fractions, though for simplicity, let’s just call
        them numbers. Now, if we were to express the algorithm for finding the sum of the first
        <i>n</i> numbers, then it might look something like the following:</p>

<pre>
wait until we get n
    let sum = 0
    let i = 1
    repeat n times
        i = i + 1
        sum = sum + i
    show sum
stop
</pre>

        <p>Here, we’re looping through a set of numbers starting from one and going up to
        <i>n</i>. On each iteration of the loop, we’re doing two things: 1) setting
        <i>i</i> to be a number between one and <i>n</i>, and then 2) we’re adding <i>i</i> to
        <i>sum</i>. Can you tell just by looking at the picture that we’ve painted so far what is
        going to determine how long our algorithm runs for? It’s <i>n</i>, right. If <i>n</i> is 1,
        then we only loop once and if it’s 10,000 then we’ll loop 10,000 times. Let’s keep this in
        mind since it could be an issue if we expect to work with problems that have large values
        of <i>n</i>.</p>

        <p>Let us now also ask, what is the fundamental operation here? Of the three operations
        that we’re doing—comparison (checking if <i>i</i> is less than or equal to <i>n</i> on each
        iteration of the loop), assignment (<i>i</i> and <i>sum</i>) and addition (<i>i</i> and
        <i>sum</i>)—the last one is clearly our fundamental operation. In other words, it’s the
        essence of what our algorithm does, so let’s focus on that.</p>

        <p>How many of those operations do we expect to do before the algorithm terminates? Well,
        we add one to <i>i</i> on each iteration of the loop in order to increment it. So by the end
        of the loop we will have added values to <i>i</i> a total of <i>n</i> times. In like
        manner, we add <i>i</i> to <i>sum</i> once per iteration, so by the end of the loop, we end
        up doing that <i>n</i> times as well. Hence, we end up doing n * n = 2n addition
        operations.</p>

        <p>There’s actually one more addition operation that we do on the very last
        iteration of the loop. We do that when we increment <i>i</i> by one, only to realize that it
        is now greater than n, and therefore reason for us to exit the loop. Although it might not
        be apparent, we do in fact use <i>i</i> to help us determine how many times we’ve gone
        through the loop and to ensure that we only go through it <i>n</i> times. Our algorithm’s
        runtime complexity may therefore be expressed as the following function.</p>

        <p class='text-center no-indent code-high-top code-high-bottom'><code>t(n) = 2n +
        1</code></p>

        <p>By looking at our runtime complexity, it should be clear that its rate of growth (also
        called its order) is linear, which is to say that if the number of elements doubles, we’d
        expect the number of operations to double. Here are a few other rate-of-growth functions
        that we typically encounter when analyzing algorithms.</p>

        <table class="table table-condensed text-center table-high-top">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>log n</td>
                    <td>n</td>
                    <td>n log n</td>
                    <td>n<sup>2</sup></td>
                    <td>2<sup>n</sup></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>constant</td>
                    <td>logarithmic</td>
                    <td>linear</td>
                    <td>linearithmic</td>
                    <td>quadratic</td>
                    <td>exponential</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>The nice thing about characterizing algorithms in terms of their rate of growth is that
        we can then tell immediately and intuitively that, say, a logarithmic algorithm will scale
        better than a linear one. If we therefore ever find the need to compare two algorithms that
        solve the same problem, and find one algorithm to be linear and the other to be
        logarithmic, for a large enough number of elements, the latter will likely be the better
        one, on average. The following chart compares a few different rates of growth. Notice how
        the differences in the number of operations performed&mdash;shown on a log-scale here&mdash;become 
        more prominent as the number of elements increases.</p>

        <div class='switch-box text-center'>
            <a class='switch no-underline active switch-to-log' href='#'>log</a> 
            <a class='switch no-underline switch-to-linear' href='#'>linear</a>
        </div>

            'mg-line4-legend-color'>&mdash;n<sup>2</sup></span>
        </div>

        <p>What’s the deal with constant time then? Can we really have an algorithm that’s fast
        regardless of the number of elements? If we write an algorithm that doesn’t depend on
        <i>n</i> whatsoever, then yes. Say we’re able to come up with an alternative algorithm to
        the one we wrote earlier that has a runtime complexity of <code>t(n)&nbsp;=&nbsp;3</code>.
        <!-- Here’s how that looks when graphed.--></p>

        <p>We call that constant time because the algorithm performs no more than a fixed number of
        operations regardless of how many elements we have. We can now improve our algorithm from
        before, which calculates the sum of <i>n</i> numbers:</p>

<pre>
wait until we get n
    let sum = n * (n + 1) / 2
    show sum
stop
</pre>

        <p>That’s much faster, don’t you&nbsp;think?</p>

        <p class='no-indent'><span class='concept-title'>HUFFMAN CODING</span>&nbsp; The brain, as
        they say in neuroscience, has the ability to detect salience. When you’re in a quiet room
        and hear a noise of any kind, your brain will pick it up. If you’re in a noisy room and
        hear a sound that is unlike those noises, your brain will pick it up too. In a sense,
        information that occurs more often is considered less meaningful, which is why the brain
        knows to filter such input.</p>

        <p>In the story you just read, the guard’s method for optimizing
        his directory for space comes partly from an idea in information theory, where it is said
        that &ldquo;only infrmatn esentil to understandn mst b tranmitd.&rdquo; The idea is part of
        a theory of communication published by the mathematician Claude Shannon in 1948. Because of
        various properties of the English language, notice that the previous sentence can be fully
        understood despite the omitted letters. Hence, information that is predictable is said to
        be redundant and may therefore be left out.</p>

        <p>In 1952, David Huffman came up with an algorithm that reduced the amount of space
        required to store information. The way computers store information is by mapping the
        letters in our alphabet&mdash;as well as numbers and other characters&mdash;to a set of
        numerical values. Those values are then stored using a language that the computer can
        understand, called <i>binary</i>. Each character is mapped to a binary code that may
        consist of seven bits. So for instance, the letter <i>a</i> is mapped to the value 97, which
        looks like this in binary:</p>

        <p class="text-center no-indent high-bottom"><code>1100001</code></p>

        <p>The letter <i>b</i> is mapped to the value 98, which looks like this in binary:</p>

        <p class='text-center no-indent code-high-top code-high-bottom'><code>1100010</code></p>

        <p>Thus, if we wanted to represent the word <i>hans</i> in binary, it would look like this,
        with each letter taking up seven bits for a total of 28 bits:</p>

        <p class='text-center no-indent code-high-top code-high-bottom'>
        <code>1101000110000111011101110011</code></p>

        <p>The nice thing about characters having binary codes with the same length (seven bits in this
        case) is that it makes decoding a binary string easy. All we have to do is read off every seven 
        bits and then use a table like <a class="underline" href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_code_chart">this one</a> to decode it
        to English.</p>

        <p>Huffman was a maverick, though. He looked at those seven bits and said, &ldquo;Ain’t nobody
        got time for that. Surely, there’s a way to compress things.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>His friends pleaded with him. &ldquo;No, Huffman,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;It can’t be done, 
        Huffman. It’s too much to ask of one man, Huffman. Don’t be a hero, Huffman. Your peers, your 
        professor have all tried to no avail, Huffman.&rdquo; But Huffman didn’t care. He was willing to 
        propel himself into the unknown, if it meant that he could potentially come up with an optimal 
        binary representation for a set of characters.</p>

        <p>Rather than using fixed-length binary codes, Huffman opted for variable-length ones. He
        exploited the fact that some characters in a sentence appear more often than other
        characters, and so he mapped the more frequently occurring letters to smaller values, and
        hence shorter binary codes, and less frequently occurring ones to longer binary codes. His
        algorithm therefore takes a body of information and uses it to generate a set of binary
        codes.
        <!-- It then uses that set to encode the information before it’s sent and to decode 
        it once it’s received. -->
        For example, say that we have determined that for a given body of information, the
        frequency distribution of characters is as follows:</p>

        <p>Notice that the characters are sorted from left to right in order of most to least
        frequent. Huffman’s algorithm takes the smallest pair of characters, sums their values,
        storing the result in a new temporary character, and then sorts the set. It repeats the
        process until we have a single pair of characters.</p>

        <p>What we end up with is essentially a tree, where each node (a character) is connected to
        the pair of nodes that it came from, with two edges: one labelled 0 and one labelled 1. If
        we do that with the above set of characters, we end up with something like the following
        table. Each column, starting from the second one, is one step of the algorithm.</p>

        <p>When we represent this table as a tree, it all becomes clear. A character’s binary code
        is the string that you get when you read off the bits from the left-most node to that
        character’s node. So for example, <i>e</i> is 11 and <i>f</i> is 10001.</p>

        <div class="huffman-tree"></div>

        <p>Here are our optimized binary codes. Notice how the more frequent letters have shorter
        codes:</p>

        <p>How does the word <i>hans</i> now look in binary?</p>

        <p class='text-center no-indent code-high-top high-bottom'><code>00101101000</code></p>

        <p>We only needed 11 bits for that rather than 28 bits. Assigning a 1 or a 0 to a 
        node’s children in the Huffman tree is done arbitrarily, i.e. <i>e</i> could have 
        been 01 instead of 11. While binary codes aren’t guaranteed to be unique, they are 
        guaranteed to be optimal. In any case, the Huffman tree is sent to the receiver 
        along with the message so that the receiver can decode the message.</p>

        <p class='no-indent'><span class='concept-title'>BINARY SEARCH</span>&nbsp; We mentioned
        earlier that a logarithmic algorithm is intuitively better than a linear one. But how
        exactly is it that we can solve a problem without inspecting all of our elements? Surely,
        if we want to say something meaningful about a collection of things, we’ll need to take a
        look at every one of those things first?</p>

        <p>To illustrate what a logarithmic algorithm looks like, let’s take search. Say that we want 
        to look up the word <i>flower</i> in a dictionary. What do we do? Well, we certainly won’t 
        turn to <i>A</i> on the very first page and then proceed line-by-line. That would take ages. 
        Instead, we open the dictionary to somewhere near the middle at, say, the Ls. Since the Fs 
        are before the Ls, we’ll completely ignore all the pages to the right and focus just on the 
        set of pages on the left. We know for sure that our word is going to be somewhere in there, 
        so that becomes our new problem space. We do the same split-and-decide-which-way-to-go action, 
        perhaps a few more times, gradually reducing the group of pages that we have to look through 
        until we finally find our word.</p>

        <p>Whenever you are able to halve the number of elements at every step, then you have a
        logarithmic algorithm on your&nbsp;hands.</p>

        <p>This particular algorithm is in fact so useful and prevalent that we have a name for it:
        <i>binary search</i>. In the story, Hans was right to flip through the directory in a way
        that’s analogous to binary search because it’s a reasonable way of searching for something
        in an ordered list. Note the use of the word &lsquo;ordered&rsquo; there. The algorithm
        only works because the words are sorted in a particular order.</p>

        <p>Now imagine that you work as a copywriter for a company that makes dinner plates. You’ve
        had this brilliant idea of adding something like this to the packaging: &ldquo;Strong
        enough to withstand a fall from the 10th floor!&rdquo; You have access to a 100-storey
        building and you would like to find out how strong the plates really are. Knowing what you
        now know about binary search, what would you do?</p>
